Javascript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
* talk about variables
* looping over
  * for - loops through a block of code a number of times
  * for/in - loops through the properties of an object (in case we want the keys -- do not use it if we care about the order)
  * for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object (to get the values - best with arrays)
* Others are forEach

Key points: 
* A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.
* JavaScript is case sensitive.
