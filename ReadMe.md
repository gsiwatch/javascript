Javascript: 
* talk about variables
* looping over
  * for - loops through a block of code a number of times
  * for/in - loops through the properties of an object (in case we want the keys -- do not use it if we care about the order)
  * for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object (to get the values - best with arrays)
* Others are forEach
*
