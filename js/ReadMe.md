#### Solid Principles:
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good developers write code that humans can understand.
~ Matin Fowler ~

* Characteristic of bad code:

    * F: Fragility: Easy to break
    * R: Rigidity: Hard to change
    * I: Immobilitity: Hard to reuse
    * V: Viscosity: Hard to do the right thing

* SOLID Principles:

    *  Single Responsibility Principle: 
        * There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. ~ uncle bob ~ 
        * High cohesion and low coupling
            
            * High cohesion: meaning methods and variables of the class are working together to achieve the result of the class
            * Low coupling: meaning degree of dependency between two modules/ classes
    * Open closed Principle:
        
        * Software entities - such as classes, modules, functions and so on - should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    * Liskov Substitution Principle:
        
        *  sub class must be able to substitute base class

    * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Dependency Inversion Principle
